# Stakeholders

**Students**
* Will enhance the learning allowing them to access a new module without the restrictions noted in the project proposal 

**Lecturers + TAs**
* More students can be taught at the same time
* Less frustrating as the labs will be more reliable

**University of Bristol**
* Could be something to display at open days so would look good for the department
* Makes use of expensive equipment that has otherwise not been used yet
