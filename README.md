# Engine
**Current Situation** 
*Jemma has been working on a framework of data for the lab. 
*She has produced two sets of data, varying in reliability, and corresponding videos demonstrating the engine producing this data. 
*The range between the two sets of data is not necessarily a problem as they want the students to understand that not all data collected can be relied upon. 

**Priorities** 
1. The students should be able to select the rotational speed of the engine using a dial on an online control panel. The video that corresponds to the results from that rotational speed should then be displayed. Videos have been formatted to contain both the engine and the real-life control panel with values, but we could display the control panel values using software. 
2. The students should have all the equipment they need to record data ‘virtually’ in front of them (e.g. a stopwatch) along with a way of recording the data within the software.  3. An accurate graph should be created from the results given by the students (possibly interactive with features like zooming but depends on time constraints) 
4. A way to check answers to unit conversions and other formulas as this is the final aim of the lab. The software would use the data inputted by the user to calculate answers then the students know they are right. 

**Extensions** 
*Although we may not get further than the above priorities in this project it is important to leave the software open to future additions. 
*The clients envisage to possibly be able to use the same software for students to interact with a diesel engine. They stated that this would be very similar to the methods for a combustion engine just with different results so we may be able to implement this ourselves.
